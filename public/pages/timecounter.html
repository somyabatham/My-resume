    <h2>Creating a Stopwatch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span>HTML Structure:</span>Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your stopwatch. This should
            include a display element to show the time, buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch, and
            a script tag to include your JavaScript code.</li>
        <li><span>CSS Styling: </span>Use CSS to style the stopwatch and make it visually appealing. You can choose
            fonts, colors, and layouts to create a cohesive design. Consider using CSS Flexbox or Grid for alignment and
            responsiveness.</li>
        <li><span>JavaScript Logic:</span>This is where the core functionality of the stopwatch is implemented. You'll
            need to use JavaScript to keep track of time and respond to button clicks. Key steps include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Declare variables to store the current time and the interval reference.
            </li>
            <li>Add event listeners to the start, stop, and reset buttons to trigger functions when the buttons are
                clicked.
            </li>
            <li>Implement the "Start" function to begin the timer using the setInterval() method and update the display
                to show the elapsed time.
            </li>
            <li>Implement the "Stop" function to clear the interval using clearInterval() and record the time when the
                stopwatch is stopped.
            </li>
            <li>Implement the "Reset" function to clear the interval, reset the display to zero, and reset any tracking
                variables.
            </li>
            <li>Use JavaScript to format and display the elapsed time, leveraging the Date object to calculate the
                time.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Throughout the process, you should test your stopwatch in different browsers and on various devices to ensure it
        works as expected. Debug any issues you encounter using your browser's developer tools.

    </p>
    <p>If you want to take your project to the next level, consider adding features like lap times, custom styling, or
        additional buttons for pausing and resuming. This will require you to expand your JavaScript logic and CSS
        styles.

    </p>

    <p>Remember that creating a stopwatch is a great way to practice and improve your web development skills. While this
        tutorial doesn't provide the actual code, you can find many open-source examples and resources online that offer
        detailed implementations to help you build your stopwatch.
