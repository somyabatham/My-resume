    <div class="container">
        <p>I am Somya Batham, an enthusiastic Front End Web Developer with a passion for crafting user-friendly and
            visually appealing websites. I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree from RGPV with a CGPA of 8.14, and I
            graduated from Shriram Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior in June 2024. My academic background
            also includes strong performances in Class XII and Class X from C.B.S. Convent H.S. School, Gwalior.</p><br>
        <p>During my studies, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and various other front-end
            technologies. I have a keen eye for design and a commitment to delivering exceptional user experiences. My
            hands-on experience includes an internship at Intelligentbots, where I worked as a Stream Trainee in
            robotics engineering, programming, and application development. This role allowed me to collaborate with
            experienced professionals and gain practical knowledge in cutting-edge technologies.</p><br>
        <p>My project portfolio showcases my versatility in web development, including projects like "Gwalior Basket,"
            an e-commerce platform for groceries, "E-LEARNING," an online education platform, and various other
            interactive web applications such as a birthday card creator, a number guessing game, and a background color
            changer component in React.</p><br>
        <p>I am self-motivated, adaptable, and always eager to learn new things. My achievements include certifications
            in C Language from Great Learning, an internship at Intelligentbots, a course on Cyber Shikhaa from Quick
            Heal Academy, and training in Supply Chain Management from Shriram Group of College. I actively participate
            in co-curricular events, demonstrating my commitment to personal and professional growth.</p><br>
        <p>With my proficiency in front-end technologies, I blend creativity with functionality, ensuring that each
            project resonates with its target audience. I am looking forward to opportunities where I can collaborate
            with creative teams and bring digital visions to life.</p>
